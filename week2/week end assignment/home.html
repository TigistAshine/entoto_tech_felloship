    <p>Elephants live in herds, which are highly organized social groups of 6-20 elephants led and guided by an older female leader, called a matriarch. As the leader of the herd, a matriarch will make all the decisions for the herd - including what to eat, where to sleep and where to go. Female elephants stay with the herd for their entire lives meaning a matriarch acts as a grandmother and/or mother to most of the herd members that include several generations of female relatives (aunts, sisters and cousins). Males (called bull elephants) will only stay with their family until adolescence (around 14 years old) when they venture out on their own and spend most of their lives alone or with other bulls.</p>

Monkeys have a brain that is large for their size and it is part of the reason why they are so intelligent. </p>
